# E-Books epubs protected with DRM
What is al this encryption of books and how to decrypt epub files.


## What is DRM?
Digital Rights Management or DRM is a scheme that controls access to copyrighted material using technological means. It may refer to the usage of proprietary software, hardware, or any type of content: music tracks, video files, ebooks, games, DVD movies, emails, documents, etc.

Adobe's Adept DRM is developed by Adobe and used in the Adobe DRM software Adobe Content Serve, and is applied to ePubs and PDFs, which can be read by many third-party e-book readers, as well as Adobe's Digital Editions software. The DRM uses a complex crypto system. Each book is encrypted using a per-book key, and this key is encrypted again using a per-user key and RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. The cipher used to encrypt the book content is AES in CBC mode with a random generated IV [Icabbages09a].


### The naming of the players
Unique resource names urn:uuid 
The distibutor has a unique id

The user gets a public and private key from adobe. Users have a unique id

The books are encrypted with AES in a bookkey. books are identified with a unique id number.  urn:uuid:

The bookkey is encrptyted with the pub key.




An ACSM file is a message file served by the Adobe Content Server to Adobe Digital Editions, a program used to manage and read eBooks as well as other digital publications. It contains data to activate and download an eBook but does not contain the eBook itself.
Th ACSM file contains
* Metainformatie of the book 
* The Distibutor id
* The book id
* HMAC   keyed-hash message authentication code 
* Transaction id



protected ePub files can only be opened using Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your PC/Mac.  Download Adobe Digital Edition: http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/  and install the latest version of Digital Editions.



## Activation 
First find my private key this can be found in the activation file of Adobe. 
<br>
Ëœ/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Digital Editions/activation.dat 

The format of the file is defined in a namespace:
namespaces = {'adept': 'http://ns.adobe.com/adept'}
This information is used to unpack the xml file.

In the XML find the tag:
//{%s}credentials/{%s}privateLicenseKey'  this is the place where your private key is.

Take the content of the privateKey

* Add '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----' 
* Append '-----END PRIVATE KEY-----'
* Run: openssl rsa -outform der>out.der and add the data above to make a certificate file

## EPUB
